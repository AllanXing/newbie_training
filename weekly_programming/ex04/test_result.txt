Insert sort test report:
  (1)Before algorithm optimization the program will cost much more time,except 
     increasing data and equivalent data.
  (2)Before algorithm optimization compiler optimization options will improve 
     the efficiency of the implementation,but it is not the more the better.
  (3)After algorithm optimization compiler optimization options will play a 
     greater role in the program.

Test data N=100000

1) Before optimization (random data)
   cost time = 24.80 seconds
   gcc -O :cost time = 3.40 seconds
   gcc -O2:cost time = 5.30 seconds
   gcc -O3:cost time = 5.30 seconds

   After optimization  (random data)
   cost time = 14.90 seconds
   gcc -O :cost time = 2.60 seconds
   gcc -O2:cost time = 2.40 seconds
   gcc -O3:cost time = 2.20 seconds

2) Before optimization (decreasing data)
   cost time = 49.8 seconds
   gcc -O :cost time = 6.80 seconds
   gcc -O2:cost time = 10.80 seconds
   gcc -O3:cost time = 10.80 seconds

   After optimization  (decreasing data)
   cost time = 29.8 seconds
   gcc -O :cost time = 5.20 seconds
   gcc -O2:cost time = 4.90 seconds
   gcc -O3:cost time = 4.50 seconds

3) Before optimization (increasing data)
   cost time = 0.01 seconds
   gcc -O :cost time = 0.01 seconds
   gcc -O2:cost time = 0.01 seconds
   gcc -O3:cost time = 0.01 seconds

   After optimization  (increasing data)
   cost time =(Approximately equal) 0 seconds
   gcc -O :cost time =(Approximately equal) 0  seconds
   gcc -O2:cost time =(Approximately equal) 0  seconds
   gcc -O3:cost time =(Approximately equal) 0  seconds

4) Before optimization (equivalent data)
   cost time =(Approximately equal) 0   seconds
   gcc -O :cost time =(Approximately equal) 0  seconds
   gcc -O2:cost time =(Approximately equal) 0  seconds
   gcc -O3:cost time =(Approximately equal) 0  seconds

   After optimization  (equivalent data)
   cost time =(Approximately equal) 0 seconds
   gcc -O :cost time =(Approximately equal) 0  seconds
   gcc -O2:cost time =(Approximately equal) 0  seconds
   gcc -O3:cost time =(Approximately equal) 0  seconds
