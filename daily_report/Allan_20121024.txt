This is Allan's daily report 20121024:

  With the improvement of living standards and the rapid development of the network,
shopping online is becoming a consumption. Favored by most of young people,because
of it has many advantages. For example,you can buy things at all times and places.
Another the price of goods online are cheaper than the physical store. However,
we must take notice of shopping online,it is a double-edged sword.
  The shop online is virtual,then when we skim trough the goods,there are maybe 
some false information on them which we can not discover. So when the goods are
sent to us,we will find that are not meet our requirements. If you want to return
the goods,there will be many difficulties waiting for you. Because of this,many 
consumer disputes take places in our life. I think it is we do not want to see,
so we must be careful when shopping online. In addition,the regulators should 
take some methods for that. In my view,the sellers operating in good faith and the 
consumers buying civilization,we will get the good shopping online environment.
