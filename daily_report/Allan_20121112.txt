This is Allan's daily report 20121112:

  When we go outside,the traffic jam is the universal phenomenon. What's more it
is serious at weekends or on holiday. Some major roads are regulary choked with
traffic in rush hours. Although the traffic jam is bad,many people still prefer 
driving outside to taking public transportation. The limited transport capacity 
contributes largely to the vexing problem. 
  In my opinion, in order to solve the problem,one of ways is to lay down more 
roads. But this way is not the effective one,it looks like can make the road 
unobstructed. However it will take up so much land the crowded cities become more
crowded. Another way is to open up more public bus lines. If more bus lines 
should be opened up,the number of cars in the main streets would be greatly 
decreased. Therefore,to lay down more roads in spacious areas and to open 
up more bus lines in downtown are the final ways.
