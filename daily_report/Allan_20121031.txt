This is Allan's daily report 20121031:

  Now email is becoming more and more popular as the rapid development of Internet.
And email has an easy access for all,especially in our work. If there are some 
notices,we will receive emails on time,because it is moreconvenient than other 
ways. In addition to work,many people connect with each other by email. It is 
great for speed and convenience so that it saves a lot of time for us. So 
considering all the benefits of email,people suspect email will replace letter 
writing.
  However there are still other people who hold the different views. They think
that a hand-written letter has more significant effect. When we receive a letter
from the people we love,we will feel the love,time and care in it. What's more
we will read it many times for the feelings. The feelings I think email can not
give to us. Therefore email is great form of communication,I am certain that letter
writing is irreplaceable.
