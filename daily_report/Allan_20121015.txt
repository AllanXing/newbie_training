This is Allan's daily report 20121015:

  Last weekend I watched a show named "I want to go on the show".It is a variety
show in order to select actors for Spring Festival Gala Evening,that has been 
held in china for over two decades.Everyone of the family will sit together,
eating and watching the Spring Festival Gala Evening at the same time.
  However,an increasing number of people have voiced different opinions towards 
it,as more divers lifestyles have emerged nowadays.Some prefer to go to a fancy 
restaurant to enjoy a gourmet meal;Others intend to have a vacation or play with 
their friends outside.They think that will be more interesting than watch the 
evening.
   In my opinion,the Evening get-together is supposed to be here to stay.It may
not remain a must for all people,but t can bring us a strong sense of festivity.
Besides,with such a gathering,family members will have a perfect opportunity to
enjoy more fun and happiness.
