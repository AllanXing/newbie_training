This is Allan's report 20121016:

  Yesterday,I studied the training courses for new employees online.The fisrt 
class told us how to use the form systerm,almost daily routine would be handled
on the system.For example,if you wanted to ask for a leave,you must filled out 
the form to apply for that.In addition,I have watched the ESD videos,which said 
how the statical electricity came about and the harmfulness to electric products.
In our daily life,we will find the statical electricity when we undressed or 
dressed the clothes.But it was not noticeable,most of people did not konw the 
harmfulness.However in the electronics industry,the static electricity was
potentially harmful.When it reached a certain degree it would destroy the electronic
component easily.Then it would bring huge economic losses to the company.
  Through the study of that,I have learned many methods to prevent the static
electricity.It just need us to take care of that,it will not lead to any losses.
