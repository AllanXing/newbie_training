This is Allan's daily report 20121123:

  For most people,most of the time they go out by the public transport. It is 
convenient and cheap for them. In our city,the public transport consist of buses,
taxi,the subways and electric bikes. The subway is much faster than taxi and buses.
So it is become our major traffic way. Today I read a news at noon,it told that
the subway had malfunctions lead to many people be held up in station. That reminds
me of the malfunctions happened in other cities recently. In ShenZhen,the subways 
had to emergency brake several times. After an investigation,the reason caused the 
subway working unusually was the wifi signal which people used. Another in ShangHai, 
the subway caught fire suddenly,and the passenger went out trough the tunnel. It is 
encouraging that there are no people getting hurt.
