This is Allan's daily report 20121114:

  Nowadays,there are all kinds of lotteries in our society. Wherever you go,you
will see the advertisements of lotteries on TV,on newspapers,in the streets and 
so on. These lotteries are divided into welfare lottery,sports lottery scratch
lottery and so on. I have bought scratch lottery just for a fun. But many people 
spend much money to buy them even do some research on trend chart before buying 
them. 
  Why are there so many people buying lotteries? In my opinion,there are some
reasons for this. First,most people are trying their luck on lottery tickets.
They have a long-cherished dream of making big money overnight. Second,some people
just like it and it can make their life more colorful,maybe someday they will
get the big money. So treating the lottery correctly you will get happiness,or 
falling into them your will lose not only money.
