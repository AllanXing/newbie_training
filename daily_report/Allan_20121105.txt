This is Allan's daily report 20121105:

  When walking in some street of town,we will find many beggars. They dressed
dirty clothes and with tousled hair. Many of them are "professional" beggars,which
means they begging as their work and make money from it. Of course,some people
are really physically disabled,which makes it impossible for them to make a living
like normal people,and they have not any relatives,so begging is their only choice.
However,some people who usually do not have any skills or abilities to do some
professional work,do not want to make a living through physical labor. They think
begging money from others is not tiring and makes them get money easily. These
people also make the real beggars can not get the money for living,it makes most
of the people very mad. 
  To solve this problem,the government should take some measures to help the real
beggars,such as providing them some work they can do for make a living and so on.
Then the "professional" beggars could be under the control.
