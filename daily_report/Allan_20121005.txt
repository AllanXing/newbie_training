This is Allan's daily report 20121005:

  Basically the National Day holiday has ended,I have two points of travel 
feelings.First, most of people playing outside are ready to go home or to work 
now.Not only the traffic jams is the biggest problem at the beginning of 
journey,but also at the ending remains the same.In the morning I listened to the 
radio,most of broadcast channels were telling the traffic programs.So the 
people driving outside should be more carefully.I hope everyone outside return
back smoothly.
  Second,I find that trvaling outside is not a easy thing,there are so many 
people and cars.Many view spots which we want to go will cost us much time
waiting,and we will walk for a long way to the destination.So it is late when we 
return back,and our common feeling is tired.I think I will not have a travel in 
this special period.
