This is Allan's daily report 20121009:

  Yesterday I saw my colleague William was taking apart the laptop,it is just a 
piece of cake to someone,but I had not seen how to do it although I had tried to
do that before.The laptop is more complex than desktop computer,the curiosity 
made me to have a closer look.Then I found it is not a mystery in my imagination 
now.
  I think each person has a curiosity,because of it we can learn more things. 
Psychologists say that curiosity is the psychological tendency of individuals 
encounter novelty or play attention to some things,ask questions in the new 
external condtions.Another curiosity is the product from the interaction of 
cognitive and emotional.Not satisfied is the human's nature,so if you want to 
know more,you should keep your curiosity.
