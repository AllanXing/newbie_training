This is Allan's daily report 20121122:

  Recently,I had read a news said that a women bought many fake eggs. After she
cooked these eggs,she found it is difficult to chew them. And there were many
pictures of these eggs below news. I had heard of fake eggs ago,but I had not 
seen what that was like. From this news I think of tow messages. First,the problem 
of food safety has become more serious. When we eat processed foods,there will 
many harmful additives; When we eat at restaurant,there will be illegal cooking 
oil; What's more,when we eat vegetables,there are even pesticide residues. Unsafe 
food will undermine our confidence in the food industry,which may cause disastrous 
effect to our economy. Second,eggs are not eggs. People can make eggs by the 
science and technology. It turn out the power of humen's wisdom.
