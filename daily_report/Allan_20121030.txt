This is Allan's daily report 20121030:

  Most people knew the story about Yuboya and Zhongziqi,they were musicians. When
one of them played music,the other would knew the feelings the player felt. They
were called bosom friend. However making friends easily and becoming the bosom
friend hardly. So many people want to know what does friendship mean? There is 
not one answer.

  Some people say friendship is to our life likes flavoring is to food. When you are
happy,friendship is just like adding flowers on brocade; When you are sad,friendship
is dose of consolation; If you are in trouble,friends will surround you and remove
the barriers for you; If you have difficulties,you can turn to friends for help.
Although we can not get our bosom friend,there are also many friends care for us.
They play a important role in our life. Friendship is not almighty,but no one can
live happily without it.
