This is Allan's daily report 20120912:  
 
   This is my second day of work. As a newbie,there are so much new
things for me. Yesterday,our leader told me what I will learn in
the next three mounths.Although the task is difficult,but I will
try my best to do it well.
   By yesterday,I had not konwn how to manage the codes. Now I have
learned to use the tool called git to do that. We use it not only
offline but also online. We can easily share our codes with others so
that the codes would be improved. Next,there will be more new things
to learn,I have confidence to be able to learn it well.
