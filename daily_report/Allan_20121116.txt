This is Allan's daily report 20121116:

  After a period of study on android,I have a further understanding of it.
Learning by examples I have known the basic widget of android and the procedure
of android development. Now I have already finished the music player,though it is
just a simple example,I still have met many problems. In order to solve them,I 
found solutions on the Internet and asked for help from colleagues. Although the
music player can operate normally,it still has many aspects to improve. 
   I found it was interesting to make a application,when it was installed in my 
cellphone and worked normally,I would have great sense of achievement. Tomorrow 
is weekend,have a rest to work better next step.
