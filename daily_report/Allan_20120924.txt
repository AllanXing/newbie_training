This is Allan's daily report 20120924:

  It is the beginning of a new week,new goals and new learing content.Doing 
anything we will set a long-term goal,but a short-term goal is also important.
If we have not,we may find our long-term goal is far from us.Then the
enthusiasm of doing things will be abatement,what's worse we will lose the 
direction.

  There is a little story also tells us how important to make a short-term goal.
During a marathon,a player I had forgotten what was his nationality,he divided 
the track into several parts,and made a short-term for each part.When he was in 
the running,he tried his best toward the short-term goal.Finally,he arrived at 
the destination insensibly and won the game.What's more there was great 
distance bettween the second.Therefore the story tell us the sense,make a short-
term goal for us will see the direction clearly.
