This is Allan's daily report 20121029:

   In the outside,most time we eat in a fast restaurant. And we will find the fast
food is more and more popular,especially among children and teenagers. Why so many
people like to eat fast food? There are several reasons for that. First,the fast
food is quick and convenient. Go into a fast food restaurant,your food will be 
ready in a minute. You can satisfy your hunger instantly. Another,your time will
not be wasted in waiting-in-line to order or waiting at your table for your food
to arrive. Second,the fast food restaurants have comfortable environment,such as
KFC or MacDonald,many people go to eat just to enjoy the environment.
  However,dietitians and public health nutritionists declare that the fast food
is not healthy enough because it does not compose a balanced diet and is low in 
nutrition. In my view,if we do not take that as our staple food for a long period,
just eat once in a while,that will not affect our healthy and we will enjoy a 
happy eating time.
