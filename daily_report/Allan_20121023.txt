This is Allan's daily report 20121023:

  All the parents expect their child to have a bright future,generally they will
give their child a thought-provoking name. For instance,some people is called 
Wangcai,which is thought to be lucky. Also there are some celebrity's names to be
used,just like a report said a freshman is called Kangxi. Although that will bring
popularity to them,in the meantime it will result in some private problems.
  In spite of all these claims, most people would agree that there is little 
evidence that names have any influence on our lives. For one thing,even if one 
was called Wangcai when he was born,and for another we will find he is not a 
billionaire after several years. In my view, it is obvious that there is no scientific
basis for the belief that there is a connection between luck and names. All in all,
it seems to me to be superstitious.
