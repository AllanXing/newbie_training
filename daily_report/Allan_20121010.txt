This is Allan's daily report 20121010:

  Everyone has his own faith,just like some people believe in Buddhism,other 
people believe in god.That only the things which our soul adore,maybe that do
not exist in the world.we believe them just they could give us spiritual support.
Of course a lot of activists do not believe that,they only believe in themselves.
They rely on their own efforts to do everything.
  
  One day,we got together and discussed Constellation.We just had fun on it at 
first,but we had found something interesting on it.When we got our own 
constellation by the birthday,we discovered many things it said match with us 
very much.Perchance it was coincidence,or when reading that we would consider 
ourselves to be that in mind.Although we konw it is incredible,it just looks 
like write for us.These things are so mysterious to us that there still many 
things we have not konwn.
