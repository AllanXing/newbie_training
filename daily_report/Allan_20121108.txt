This is Allan's daily report 20121108:

  The whole day of training courses was ended,walked in the corridor,I felt the 
air was very cold,I found it was raining outside. It occurs to me that yesterday 
was the beginning of winter,the weather is getting more and more colder.
  During the training courses,the teacher told us the core products of our company.
For example,laptop,cellphone and server etc. He said the science and technology
developed rapidly,when he had his first phone,he could not think of that some
day there was not keyboard on cellphone. It just explained that fast electronic 
products generation replacement. How powerful the science and technology! We can 
not imagine that what the cellphone will be like in the future.
