This is Allan's daily report 20121025:

  When go off of work,we will find many staffs smoke together out of the door.
They can not smoke in the office or at workshop comfortably,it is insufferable
to a chain-smoker for a long time. However it is known to everyone that smoking
is harmful to our health. Many research conducted in many countries has indicated
that smoking causes lung cancer,heart disease and various respiratory illnesses.
But that can not keep the smoker from smoking. Another the second-hand smoke will
cause serious diseases to non-smokers. What's worse,there is a high probability 
of getting illnesses for non-smokers.

   According to this problem,many governments have heavy taxes on tobacco products,
others have conducted anti-smoking campaigns. But none of the governments have even
considered prohibiting the sale of tobacco. Because that will affect the political
power and the profit of some farmer. Therefore,smoking is not only a matter of habit
but also a matter of profits.
