This is Allan's daily report 20121019:

  With the development of science and technology,most of physical diseases can 
be cured now,but the psychological illness can not be cured easily. That mainly 
caused by working pressure,feelings of frustration and so on. From the news,we 
will find many troubles such as suicides,as a result of psychological illness. 
These events happened in many companies repeatedly. Undoubtedly,companies should
take great account in the responsibilities of staffs's psychological health. 
Relevant courses and activities should be introduced to staffs so that they would
be more aware of the significance of psychological health and find appropriate 
ways to maintain and improve it.
  Of course no psychological health can be obtained without the efforts from the
staffs themselves. From my perspective,what we can do is trying to stay positive
and optimistic. Before going to work,we can think some happy things and maintain
a happy mood. Although we will meet many problems at work or in private matters,
we must know anything can be solved,because we have relatives and friends.
