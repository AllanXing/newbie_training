This is Allan's daily report 20120926:

  Today when I arrive at office,I find many people have gotten the mooncakes.
There are two mooncakes in a exquisite box,it looks very beautiful.See it I
think of that the mooncake package was extremely simple many years ago,even 
you won't feel it is delicious if you had not eaten it.At that time,we ate 
moon cake with our family just to remember a beautiful legend.It represents 
people's best wishes for reunion and happiness.

  Now,it has another meaning since it has covered with a new package,along with
that the price has turned over several times.So the beautiful appearance and
high prices represent a person's identity.Many people send it to others as 
gift.Yesterday,I listened to the radio,that said the the bank made moon cakes
from the gold in order to as a souvenir.I think none of us know the moon cakes
will be changed into what or they will represent what.
