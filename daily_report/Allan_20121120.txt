This is Allan's daily report 20121120:

  Today the newbie training courses has ended,think back to these lessons,many 
content I do not work with them directly. But through them I have known more
about our company and corporate culture. Another there are many departments,I 
have known how they cooperate with each other. If there are some problems on my 
work,I will know which department I should ask for help.
  The final lesson told us what is career development and how to plan the career.
The teacher shared his experience to us. Sometimes just a little thing would 
affect one's career development. It was not at school,if we made mistakes,we could
be forgave by our teachers. Now in company the competition is fierce and the
responsibility is major. So serious working attitude will bring us many benefits.
What is called â€œno pains,on gains".
