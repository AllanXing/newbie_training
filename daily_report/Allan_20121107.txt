This is Allan's daily report 20121107:

  Nowadays,there are many chat tools on the Internet,such as QQ,MSN,Micro message
and so on. I think most of young people use at least one of them,it is convenient
and efficient for us to communicate with our friends by them. In addition,we can 
acquainted with net friends from anywhere without any limitations,enriching
our life experiences and even extending our knowledge. What's more,it is not rare
many people to find their bosom friends and even Mr. or Mrs. Right. Even though
there were some people succeed to find their best friends or Mr. or Mrs. Right,
most of people failed and had emotional hurt. What's worse,some people were 
murdered by the net friends.
  So,in my opinion we should make good use of these chat tools to keep in touch
with our friends instead of falling victims to that.
