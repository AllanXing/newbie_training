This is Allan's daily report 20120920:

   More than one weeks have passed already, I am familiar with my work
environment and know well about what I have to do everyday.Yesterdy our leader 
gave me some comments on what I have done recently.There although had some 
progress but also more shortage,so I have to learn more and do practices in 
order to work better.
  Writing codes and reading codes are boring things,I think each one do it for
a long time will has the same feeling.Codes is uninsteresting however we could 
find some interesting things from there.For example,we write a program and 
then run it,if we get the desired result then we will feel happy and forget 
how it is tedious.Thus we will get the power from that to write more 
programs.At the same time,we make progress insensibly.
