This is Allan's daily report 20121017:

  Now the modern society is the information society,we can surf the internet by
many tools always and everywhere.It is convenient for us to get information from
internet.When on your way to work,you can view news or weather report by your 
cellphone.And at the office,you also could get any infomation by your computer.
So,the internet is around us in any places.
  However,some people think that the internet has a bad effect on the growth of 
teenagers.They are too young to regist some temptations from the internet.It is
true that many teenagers learn to have broken down from the internet,but we must
know there are always two sides to everything.In my opinion,we should pay more
attention to the advantages of the Internet and make the most of it.Meanwhile
we should teach the teenagers how to use the internet positively,and make the
internet as a tool for their healthy develpment.
