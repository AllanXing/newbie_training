This is Allan's daily report 20120917:

  We have our dreams,then we determine the direction and try to make it. After 
graduation,we need work. Before going to work,we must know what we want to be. 
If we find a job rashly,it is bad for our career development.

  However,finding a suitable job is not a easy thing. We may meet many 
failures.We shoud not give up in spite of that,because we have our dreams. it 
is not easy to get my first job,some were suit to me but I was rejected 
because I had not any work experiences.Another,some jobs I thought were not 
suit to my career development although they could provide me many welfare. Now 
I find the job is suit me,so I will take it to heart and do it well.
