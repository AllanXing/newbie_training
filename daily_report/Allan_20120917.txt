  We have our dream,then we determine the direction and try to make it. After 
graduation,we will be faced with work. Before going to work,we must know what 
we want to do. If we find a job casually,it is bad for our career developent.

  However,finding a suitable job is not a easy thing. we may meet much failure.
we shoud not give up in spite of that,because we have our dream. I get my
first job also not easily,some were suit to me but I was refused for I had not
any work experiences.Another,some jobs I thought were not suit to my career 
development although they could provide me many welfare. Now I find the job is
suit me,so I will take it to heart and do it well.
