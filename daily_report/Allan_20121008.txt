This is Allan's daily report 20121008:

  â€œOh,the holiday is over!","First day of work after vacation,I do not want to
go to work" and so on.These are the feelings many people say in their micrblogs 
or personal homepages.And we will see most of people appearing to be tired.These
behaviors are called Holiday Syndrome.That is to say if we work for a long period
and then we have a long-awaited holiday,we will play to enjoy the holiday to the
top of ours bent.This will bring about a result of physical and mental fatigue.

  Therefore,when we have a holiday to relax ourselves,we should keep one day or 
more to adjust our state.Then we will have good condition to work.
