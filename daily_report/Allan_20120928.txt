This is Allan's Daily report 20120928:

  In two days is National Day,I read a news in the morning it say that there is
a large National Day flower basket in Tiananmen square in order to celebrate 
National Day.It is so huge and beautiful that a lot of people travel to see it.
The motherland has ushered in a 63-year-old's birthday.The people were suffering
in the life 63 yeas ago,now we have a peace life,everyone of us should remember
the day that motherland was liberated.Therefore it is necessary to take some of
the ways to celebrate the memorable day.

  Recently sino-japanese diaoyu island event has brought many things,a lot of 
patriotic personage protest strongly against Japan's behavior on diaoyu islan.
Many people go to streets in protest,I think it is very necessary to prove we
are not bullied,but we should not do some bad things to the compatriot.
