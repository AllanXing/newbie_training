  It is my first day for newbie training of face-to-face courses. The most of 
teachers are the senior leader. They tell us the things we can not learn from

Wistron as a large company,it's development is not a short duration of time.
There are 5S standard for the whole company,each department follow the standard
to do their work better. It not only for the whole,but also carry out by each
individuals.
