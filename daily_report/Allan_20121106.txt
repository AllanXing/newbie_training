This is Allan's daily report 20121106:

  It is my first day for newbie training of face-to-face courses. Most of 
teachers are the senior leader. They tell us the things we can not learn from
textbooks. For example,through the lessons,we have known the proper nouns of
factories, and understood the relationship among some key departments. Another
Wistron is a large company,it's development cost a long duration of time.
There are 5S standard for the whole company,each department follow the standard
to do their work better. It is not only for the whole to do that,but also should
carry out by each individuals.
