  Along with the raise of people consumption level,advanced consuming is not the
western concept of consumption. The phenomenon performances in that more and more
young people apply for a credit card. When they have it will be able to buy now
and pay later,most people use that for this advantage. However,there are dangers
associated with credit cards. Many people find it very easy to exceed their budget.
It is tempted to purchase goods that they do not really need,and become quickly
overburdened by debt. The credit card often charge a high rate of interest,which
exacerbates the problems for these people.
  Therefore,we must use a credit card rationally. Thus it can improve the quality
of our lives,and it can give us access to money to meet sudden unplanned expenses.
