This is Allan's daily report 20121026:

  With the development of information technology,e-books have attracted the 
attention from all our society. When we go to the libraries,there are many
e-books in the Electronic Reading Room. We can also download the e-books which we 
like on the Internet. More and more books are made to be e-books, it is 
convenient for us to read them,and most of them are free of charge. So some
people claim that the e-books will substitute the traditional ones. They think 
the e-books bring them great amount of convenience and save a lot of money for 
them,however the traditional books are too heavy and bulk for us to carry. There 
are much more advantages than traditional books.
  From my perspective,I firmly believe the e-books can not take the traditional 
books's place totally. Because we can not get the reading sense from e-books,on 
the contrary,we can do it from traditional books. I think most of  people have 
the same feeling. Therefore,the e-books and the traditional books are preferable 
to different people,and both of them can bring us benefits.
