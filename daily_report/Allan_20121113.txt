This is Allan's daily report 20121113:

  Advertisements can be seen everywhere around us. They are forcing their way into
our lives. If there are not advertisements in some places,we will fell it is not
normal. The advertisers are usually manufacturers,retailers and salesmen. Their 
foods need to be advertised to bring it to the attention to the customers. So 
nearly every products are advertised in some ways. 
  Therefore,there are so many advertisements in different forms.such newpapers,TV,
Internet and so on. Most of them are usually advertised many times. When we are 
watching TV programs,it is boring to see them. But we also need advertisements 
to get some information,it can help us buy the suitable goods. Thus advertisements 
promote the sale of goods,also they bring us some troubles.
