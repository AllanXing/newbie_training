This is Allan's daily report 20121121:

  It is raining outside. On every rainy days,many people will be late for work.
Why are there so many people come late? I think there are two important reasons.
First,if it is raining,the weather will become colder than normal day. Many
people will be lazy and do not want to get up. When they are aware of the time,
it is too late to arrive on time. Second,if the weather is bad,the regular buses 
will be fewer than before. And the traffic jams is also the key problem. I almost
be late because of the reason today. 
  Laziness exist in everyone's spirit. It also becomes our excuse for our fault. 
Therefore,the only way to solve the problem is to get over laziness and to get up 
early.
