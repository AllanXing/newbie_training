This is Allan's daily report 20121011:

  There is a very popular saying that money is not everything, but no money is 
totally unacceptable.Each person has his opinion about money,Some people think 
that money is the source of happiness.If they have enough money,they can buy 
whatever they want.With money,they can do whatever they like.So,money can bring 
them status,comfort,security and so on.Therefore money in their mind,is the source
of happiness.
  However there are still a lot of people who against the opinion,they think 
money is the root of all evil.Money drives people to steal,to rob,and to break 
the law.Many people became criminals just because they were in search of money.
On account of money,a lot of give up their scanctity to become the slave of 
money.
  I think that money is essential to life and we can not do without money.Even 
though money is necessary to our life,there are many things can not buy by money,
for example love,healthy etc.
