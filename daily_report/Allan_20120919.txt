This is Allan's daily report 20120919:

  During traditional festival,most of people outside are eager to go home. 
There are some problems appearing,it is difficult to buy the train tickets 
because of so many people do it at the same time and the tickets are limited.
That is to say there are many persons can not go home at their time.The 
situation turn into problem many years,although the Ministry of Railways try 
to solve it,but as the outgoing person constantly on the rise,that has not any 
significant effect.
  The National Day holiday is comming with Mid-autumn Day,it is a long time
vacation for us.Everyone plan to go home,I can not go not only the ticket 
problem but also for some personal reasons.
