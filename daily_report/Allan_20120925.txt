This is Allan's daily report 20120925:

  Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon,there is a poetry tells the voices of 
everyone.It said that I'm far away from my hometown and I miss my family 
especially when fesitival is coming.Mid-autumn festival is a traditional 
festival for family unification.On that day,each of the family will eat moon 
cake and enjoy the glorious full moon together.It is important for Chinese 
people preceded only by New Year's Day.

  Yesterday we got the corporate welfare of moon cake certificate,although I can
not go home at Mid_Autumn Day,when I eat the moon cake,just like with my family.
I wish my parents healthy.
