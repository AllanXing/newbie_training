  Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon,there is a poetry points the voices of 
everyone.It said that a lonely stranger in a strange land I am cast, I miss my 
family all the more on every festival day.Mid-autumn festival is a traditional 
festival for family unification.On that day,each of the family will eat moon 
cake and enjoy the glorious full moon together.It is important for chinese 
people preceded only by New Year's Day.

  Yesterday we got the corporate welfare of moon cake certificate,although I can
not go home at Mid_Autumn Day,when I eat the moon cake,just like with my family.
I wish my parents healthy.
