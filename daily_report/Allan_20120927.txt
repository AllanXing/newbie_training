This is Allan's Daily report 20120927:

  Approaching holidays,many people are eager to go home or go to travel.
Hearing the sounds around,a lot of people have the same mood.The upcoming 
holiday is a long vacation indeed,it is full of temptation to the people at 
work.After a long period working pressure,most of people want to have a rest 
to relax themselves.The feelings could be understood,because when I as a 
student have many vacations also look forward to the holiday.

  In order to have a reassuring holiday,I think we must complete the work
seriously,on account of that we often have the holiday syndrome.Then our 
working efficiency will become low,the work will be more and more.It is bad 
for our enthusiasm of work.
