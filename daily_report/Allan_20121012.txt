This is Allan's daily report 20121012:

  Each friday there is a weekly meeting of department.At the meeting we share 
our opinions with others,if someone have problems at work,we will discuss them 
together to get the result.Of course,there are often some problems we can not
get the result,then the problems will be gone to record to find the way to solve 
them next step.After issues are resolved we will have the plan next week,when we
have the clear target we will do the work efficiently.So the weekly meeting is 
good way to let us to find problems and to solve them,we will improve our abilities
insensibly.

  Tomorrow is Saturday,after a week's work,I wish everyone will have a nice 
weekend.Best regards!
