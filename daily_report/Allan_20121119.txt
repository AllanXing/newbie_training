This is Allan's daily report 20121119:

  In recent years,more and more people begin to fall in love with the western 
festivals. For instance,Hallowmas as a western spirit festival comes into our
lives. Many portal sites and shopping websites take it as stunts to publicize
their service or products. It is just a little festival,however there are many 
well-known western festivals,such as Christmas Day,Valentine's Day and so on.
  Why so many western festivals are well received? There are a variety of 
reasons responsible for this trend. First,many younger generations are exposed 
to western culture and lifestyles through the national trend of learning English. 
Second, western festivals are heavily targeted by businessmen. Who view them as 
good opportunities to make money. They take advantage of the people's curiosity
to launch a sales promotion. So we should have rational consumption and not 
pursuit the western culture blindly.
