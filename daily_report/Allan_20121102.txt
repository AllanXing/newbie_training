This is Allan's daily report 20121102:

 Sometime when surfing the Internet,we may read someone's story or listen to a
new song at first,then we will find the story or song's owner to be widely known.
Could it be said  that achieving great fame overnight though the Internet? I think
it is. Nowadays,there emerge various kinds of Internet celebrities. We have to
believe in that how strong the power of Internet.

  Some people regard it as a sign of social progress. The Internet provides equal 
opportunities for everyone to show himself and express himself freely. Besides,
the Internet celebrities's rising fame has greatly encouraged ordinary people
who dream of becoming a star. On the contrary,others think that many Internet
celebrities just hype through the Internet,rather than have true capabilities.
As far as I am concerned,we should be more open-minded to the Internet celebrities.
Don't envy them blindly,if you have true ability,you will shine anywhere.
