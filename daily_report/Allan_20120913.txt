   Work is different from school. There are tougher elimination, you
have to learn more by yourself in order to do the job well. If you do
not, you will be eliminated.In the school,you studied by following the
teachers. If you did not pass the test,you would have another chance.
However at work,if you did not do the test well,you would be fired.
   Colleagues are not only your colleagues,but also your firends and
teachers.At the beginning,you have difficulties on the work,you could
ask for advice from your colleagues.Though the exchange,you will be
firends,then Harmonious environment is established.Thus the mood of
our work will be happniess.Finally,the work efficiency will be
