This is Allan's daily report 20121101:

  Today I read a report about how many people died result of drunk-driving.
Drinking is our customs on every festival,thus many accidents happened at that 
time. When the people lost their relatives,they will find how dangerous drunk-driving
is. After an accident happened,it means a mournful waste of time and money to treat
the injured and fix the crashed cars.

  So prompt and effective measures should be taken to reduce drunk-driving before
things get worse. On the one hand,it is essential the laws and regulations should
be strictly enforced to impose heavy penalty on those who violate the rules.
Recently the government issue a new law,if some one drive after drinking,he will
be revoked the license. On the other,more efforts should be made to arouse public
consciousness,such as propagating the bad influence of drunk-driving.
