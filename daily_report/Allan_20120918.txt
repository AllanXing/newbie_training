This is Allan's daily report 20120918:

  Detail decides success or failure.I have found I often make mistakes
on spelling,I konw that but when I type it will make the mistake
unconsciously. That looks like just a little mistake,but in other places 
it maybe leads to serious consequences. Therefore I must take care of 
that to avoid making spelling mistakes.
  Habits decide fate,but good habits are not formed naturally,however bad 
habits such as lazy are often formed naturally.So we want to self-control
to develop good habits,and this culture is not easy thing.It is long time 
for someone to insist on it.
