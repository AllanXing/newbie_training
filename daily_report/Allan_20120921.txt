This is Allan's daily report 20120921:

  Tomorrow is saturday,I wish each one of my department has a nice weekend.
There are six persons in our department,everyone is firendly to me.If I have
some problems or troubles,they are happy to help me.Our leader Mr jiang,he is 
easygoing for he is just a little older than us,another he often plays jokes 
with others. In addition,as a leader,he is very strict.It is good for the
newbie,we can find more shortages to correct them and do work more seriously.
  Now I have finished the study of char diriver,just a part of it ,even so 
there still a lot of things should keep on learning for me.The next study will 
be more difficult.I will try my best to learn it well within the limited time.
